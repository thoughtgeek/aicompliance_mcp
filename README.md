A production-ready, Kubernetes-native system for EU AI Act compliance documentation, risk assessment, and regulatory querying. This microservices architecture provides organizations with tools to understand, implement, and maintain compliance with the European Union's Artificial Intelligence Act.

## üîç Overview

The EU AI Act introduces comprehensive regulations for AI systems based on risk categories, requiring organizations to implement proper governance, risk assessment, and documentation processes. This system provides:

- Semantic search across EU AI Act regulatory content
- Structured knowledge representation of compliance requirements
- AI-powered compliance assessment and guidance
- Verifiable, source-traceable responses for audit readiness
- API-first design for integration with existing compliance tools

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](docs/architecture-diagram.txt)

The system consists of five specialized microservices designed for efficient operation in Kubernetes:

### Knowledge Graph Service (TerminusDB)
- Stores structured regulatory data with relationships
- Models complex compliance relationships and dependencies
- Enables graph-based queries and traversals

### Vector Database Service (Qdrant)
- Enables semantic search across compliance documentation
- Stores high-dimensional vector embeddings of regulatory content
- Provides similarity-based retrieval with configurable thresholds

### Embedding Service
- Converts text queries to vector representations
- Optimized for minimal resource consumption
- Supports batched processing for efficiency

### LLM Service
- Generates factually grounded responses using retrieved knowledge
- Supports multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama)
- Includes factual verification and source tracing

### API Gateway
- Orchestrates workflows between components
- Provides a unified RESTful API interface
- Handles request routing, validation, and response formatting

## ‚ú® Features

- **Enterprise-Ready**: Production-grade components with health monitoring and horizontal scaling
- **Resource-Efficient**: Optimized for minimal resource consumption with configurable limits
- **Multi-Model Support**: Choose from OpenAI, Anthropic, or deploy local models via Ollama
- **Semantic Search**: Advanced vector-based search with relevance scoring
- **Fact Grounding**: All responses traced to specific regulatory sources for audit readiness
- **Flexible Deployment**: Deploy on any Kubernetes environment (cloud, on-premise, or local)
- **Customizable**: Modular design for easy extension and customization

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster (local or cloud)
- kubectl command-line tool
- Docker for local development
- Ingress controller (for external access)

### Quick Start (Local Development)

For local development with kind (Kubernetes IN Docker):

1. Install kind and create a cluster:
```bash
[ $(uname -m) = x86_64 ] && curl -Lo ./kind https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/v0.27.0/kind-linux-amd64
chmod +x ./kind
sudo mv ./kind /usr/local/bin/
kind create cluster --name eu-ai-act
```

2. Add local hostname:
```bash
echo "127.0.0.1 eu-ai-act.local" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

3. Deploy the system:
```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/namespace.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/qdrant/
kubectl apply -f k8s/terminusdb/
kubectl apply -f k8s/embedding/
kubectl apply -f k8s/llm/
kubectl apply -f k8s/api-gateway/
```

4. Verify deployment:
```bash
kubectl get pods -n eu-ai-act
```
kubectl get pods -n eu-ai-act

Access the API at http://eu-ai-act.local/

### Production Deployment

For production deployment:

1. Configure persistent storage:
```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/storage-class.yaml
```

2. Update resource limits in deployment files for production workloads

3. Configure TLS for secure communication:
```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/certificates.yaml
```

4. Deploy monitoring stack:
```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/monitoring/
```

## üíª Development Workflow

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/eu-ai-act-compliance.git
cd eu-ai-act-compliance
```

2. Install development dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run individual components locally:
```bash
cd src/api-gateway && python app.py
```

4. Build and push Docker images:
```bash
docker build -t yourusername/eu-ai-act-api-gateway:latest src/api-gateway/
docker push yourusername/eu-ai-act-api-gateway:latest
```

5. Run tests:
```bash
pytest src/tests/
```

### CI/CD Pipeline

This repository includes GitHub Actions workflows for:
- Automated testing on pull requests
- Code quality and linting checks
- Security scanning
- Image building and publishing
- Kubernetes manifest validation

## üìä API Endpoints

  "capabilities": ["candidate_ranking", "automated_decision"],
  "data_sources": ["resumes", "job_descriptions"]
}
```

## üìö Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. Pod Crash Looping: Check resource limits and logs
```bash
kubectl logs -n eu-ai-act -l app=api-gateway
kubectl describe pod -n eu-ai-act -l app=api-gateway
```

2. Service Connectivity: Verify service discovery
```bash
kubectl exec -it -n eu-ai-act deploy/api-gateway -- curl embedding-service:8000/health
```

3. API Errors: Check API Gateway logs
```bash
kubectl logs -n eu-ai-act -l app=api-gateway -f
```
